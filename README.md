# Performance Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
This project compares the performance of five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. The analysis focuses on measuring the average, best, and worst-case execution times, maximum memory usage, and algorithm stability. The study provides insights into the efficiency of each sorting method using varying dataset sizes.
